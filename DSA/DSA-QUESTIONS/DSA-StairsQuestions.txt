Here are **50 DSA questions related to Stairs Climbing and similar logical patterns** (mostly involving recursion, dynamic programming, combinatorics, and optimization). These problems follow patterns like Fibonacci, counting paths, jump options, constraints, and obstacles.

### 🧗‍♂️ **Basic Climbing Stairs Pattern**

1. Climb N stairs (1 or 2 steps at a time) – total ways
2. Climb N stairs (1, 2, or 3 steps) – total ways
3. Climb stairs if only steps of 2 or 3 are allowed
4. Climb stairs with only even step sizes allowed
5. Number of ways to climb N stairs with given array of steps (e.g., {1, 3, 5})
6. Min number of steps to reach top (1 or 2 at a time)
7. Count ways to climb stairs with some broken steps (blocked indices)
8. Count ways to reach nth stair with max K steps
9. Count distinct paths from stair 0 to N using 1 or 2 steps
10. Count number of binary strings of length N with no two consecutive 1s (similar logic)

### 🔁 **DP Optimization Variants**

11. Climbing stairs using memoization (top-down)
12. Climbing stairs using tabulation (bottom-up)
13. Space-optimized solution for climbing stairs
14. Count ways to reach stair N with at most K steps
15. Find all sequences of steps to climb N stairs
16. Check if N stairs can be climbed using only 2 and 5 step sizes
17. Count number of valid sequences to reach stair N using 1 and 2 steps
18. Return all paths taken to climb N stairs (print actual sequences)
19. Number of permutations to climb N stairs with given step array
20. Count ways to reach nth step with no three consecutive steps

### 🔀 **Jump Game Variants**

21. Jump Game I: Can reach end of array
22. Jump Game II: Minimum jumps to reach end
23. Jump Game III: Can jump back and forth (with visited checks)
24. Minimum number of jumps to reach last index using DP
25. Jump Game with energy cost on each index
26. Jump Game with forbidden positions
27. Jump Game with teleporting steps (jump to i + arr\[i])
28. Maximum score from stair climbing with energy array
29. Reach stair N minimizing fatigue (cost-based jump)
30. Jump Game with recharge step every K steps

### 🚶‍♂️ **Path/Movement-Based Questions (Stair-Like)**

31. Count number of ways to climb a ladder
32. Frog jumps: Jump 1 to K steps at a time
33. Count ways to reach floor N from floor 0
34. Staircase with rest every 3rd stair — skip it
35. Climb N stairs with constraint: No two 2s in a row
36. Reach N using odd-sized steps only
37. Return number of distinct increasing sequences summing to N
38. Stair path with max jump length from each stair (like array\[i])
39. Staircase where some stairs give points/penalties — maximize score
40. Climb N stairs with cooldown after every 2 steps

### 🔄 **Backtracking + Bitmask + Combinatorial Variants**

41. Return all valid combinations of steps for N stairs
42. Count partitions of N using numbers {1,2}
43. Number of ways to partition N using given set of steps
44. Number of subsets whose sum is N (stair-like logic)
45. Ways to climb stairs using a bitmask to track steps taken
46. Count ways to reach stair N if some steps are forbidden (input: blocked\[] array)
47. Count distinct ways using DFS and memoization
48. Stair climbing with jumps and return — climb and descend
49. Stairs climbing game — you can skip K steps after every 2
50. Climb N stairs using steps that are powers of 2 only
