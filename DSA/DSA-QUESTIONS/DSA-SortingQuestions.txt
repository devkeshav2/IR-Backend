Here is a practice list of 100 useful *sorting-focused DSA questions* you can work through in Java or your language of choice. These are based on common interview patterns and problems where sorting is a core part of the solution or helps optimize performance (many inspired by collections of sorting and array tasks seen in interview prep sites).

## 📌 How to Practice This List

💡 Start simple: work through items 1–30, solve them in Java, and time yourself.
💡 Use built-in sort where allowed, but also implement core algorithms manually to deepen understanding.
💡 Tag your problems by pattern: e.g., sort + two pointers, sort + heap, sort + custom comparator. ([GeeksforGeeks][1])

## 🧠 Tips for Sorting Questions

✅ Learn core sorting algorithms and time/space complexity
✅ Practice transforming a problem into a sort + two pointers solution
✅ For harder problems, combine sort with heaps, sliding windows, or Greedy
✅ Keep track of constraints — sorting every problem isn’t optimal if better patterns exist
